# DT508 Game Programming Assignments 2015-2016

Assignment 1

Create an animated Christmas card in Processing. You must make the Christmas card for someone and give it to that person. 
Here are some examples of previous assignments that students have done:

These should be demoed in the class on 7 December. Alternatively if you are doing Gamecraft on teh Saturday, make a game in Processing and submit that!

In your christmas card you should use:

- Procedural drawing (no sprites!)
- Variables
- The if statement
- Loops
- Methods
- Arrays

Marking scheme:

| Complexity | Code | Visuals | Jazz |
|------------|----|---------|------|
|30%         |20% |20%      |30%   |

Rubric:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Animation, loops, arrays and methods used extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Some simple interactivity such as a game. Use of keyboard, mouse or controller input. Music and fonts. Use of some advanced features of Processing we havent covered in class such as classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code|
| 2.1 | Lots of animation, loops and arrays. Methods. Also using audio and fonts. Little or no interactivity. Between 100 and 200 lines of code |
| 2.2 | No animation or simple back and forth type animation, use of loops, but no arrays. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code|
| Pass | No animation. No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesnt work. 20-50 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |

# Assignment 2 - Christmas Assignment

Over Christmas, you should use all the programming skills you have built up this semester to create a version of the classic Atari game Arkenoid/Breakout in Processing:

This is an individual assignment. You can use whatever features of the Processing language you want including stuff that you teach yourself. You must make everything yourself and will not get any marks for sprites or code you include that you find online. If you want to use sprites instead of drawing everything, you must make these yoursef too. I expect you to spend around 15-20 hours on this assignment.

|------------|----|---------|------|
|30%         |20% |20%      |30%   |

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Multiple levels and powerups. Splash and game over screens. Progression and depth to the gameplay. Use of loops, arrays and methods extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Use of lots of advanced features of Processing we havent covered in class such as files, classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code |
| 2.1 | A single level, with bricks, a bat, a ball, scoring and collisions. Everything works. Between 100 and 200 lines of code. Correct use of methods, parameters, loops and arrays |
| 2.2 | A single level, with bricks, a bat, a ball, scoring but no collisions or some other significant bugs. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code |
| Pass | No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesnt work. < 100 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |

Rules!

- As much as possible this project should be 100% your own code. You will not get any marks for any code that include that you get from books or from the internet. This assignment is about testing what *you* have learned and what *you* can do.
- Any suspected plagorism will be dealt with according to DIT General Assessment Regulations. This could mean expulsion from DIT. I will personally grade all assignments.
- There will be a feedback session after the assignment where you will have the opportunity to get individual feedback on your submissiona and have your mark explained to you.
- The date for submission is before the lab, the week of 1 Feb 2016. 
- All assignment submissions must be demoed in the lab that week.
- If you need to submit an assignment late, you must submit a PC/1 form to the exams office.

Assignment 3

Assignment 3
============

Come up with an idea for a game and and implement it in Processing. I suggest you use a game you are making for one of your other subjects on this course. For example a board game or card game. You must make *everything* yourself. Game design, Sprites (if you want to use sprites), audio and programming. I expect you do have to do some self directed learning on this project and include stuff you havent learned in my class. In addition to submitting your game and demoing in the class I need each person to submit two videos! 

- A gameplay video I can use to make a showreel from the class
- A max 10 minute video tutorial on something new you learned when making the assignment

This is worth a flat 20% of your mark for this assignment. You should use git to manage your code on the assignment    

Marking Scheme:
Video: 15% Complexity:30% Project management: 30% Visuals: 25%

Submission dates:
- 10 March - Short game design document written in markdown and your git hub link
- 14 April Project submission and demos. Submit git link & video link via Google docs 

Rubric:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | A project that looks great. All the art and is 100% procedural or self drawn and looks beautiful. There a significant amount of clever animation or gameplay (if the project is a game). For example multiple "modes" or "screens". The assignment has lots of functionality. There is depth to the assignment. For example, progression and powerups. The code is organised into classes. There is a lot of novelty and originality. All the code is written by the you. You will have used PVectors, transforms and classes to create autonomous elements in the assignment. You will loading content from text files. You will have used git extensively. Your project will significant amount of new code - not just variations on stuff I wrote. Similar to the complexity of tower defense. Everything works. > 40 git checkins|
| 2.1 | The project looks good. There is a some animation or gameplay. You put in a good effort. Some features may not be complete or entirely working. Probably no file IO, but there should be while loops, for loops if statements etc to control aspects of the assignment. Complexity of a shooter like space invaders or asteroids or snake. A lot of code from my examples, modified. 20-40 git checkins |
| 2.2 | The project looks so so, but is pretty basic. There should be some animation or gameplay but significant issues that you couldn't resolve. All the movement and animation code will be pretty basic for example colours changing each frame or movement controlled by variables that just update each frame. Little or no control code. There is not much code, maybe a page or two. Pong. Between 10 and 20 checkins |
| Pass | All code in one file. Around a hundred lines of code. Looks like it could have been completed in an hour or two. Mostly drawing code, little or no controling code. Little or no functionality. Non-working pong. Lots of code acquired from other sources. < 10 checkins |
| Fail | Something very basic that looks like it could have been completed in an hour. Just drawing code, no control code. The assignment has no interactivity. Significant unaddressed technical problems. No git usage.  |

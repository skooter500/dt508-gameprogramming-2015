# DT508 Game Programming Assignments 2015-2016

Assignment 1

Create an animated Christmas card in Processing. You must make the Christmas card for someone and give it to that person. 
Here are some examples of previous assignments that students have done:

These should be demoed in the class on 7 December. Alternatively if you are doing Gamecraft on teh Saturday, make a game in Processing and submit that!

In your christmas card you should use:

- Procedural drawing (no sprites!)
- Variables
- The if statement
- Loops
- Methods
- Arrays

Marking scheme:

| Complexity | Code | Visuals | Jazz |
|------------|----|---------|------|
|30%         |20% |20%      |30%   |

Rubric:

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Animation, loops, arrays and methods used extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Some simple interactivity such as a game. Use of keyboard, mouse or controller input. Music and fonts. Use of some advanced features of Processing we havent covered in class such as classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code|
| 2.1 | Lots of animation, loops and arrays. Methods. Also using audio and fonts. Little or no interactivity. Between 100 and 200 lines of code |
| 2.2 | No animation or simple back and forth type animation, use of loops, but no arrays. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code|
| Pass | No animation. No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesnt work. 20-50 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |

# Assignment 2 - Christmas Assignment

Over Christmas, you should use all the programming skills you have built up this semester to create a version of the classic Atari game Arkenoid/Breakout in Processing:

This is an individual assignment. You can use whatever features of the Processing language you want including stuff that you teach yourself. You must make everything yourself and will not get any marks for sprites or code you include that you find online. If you want to use sprites instead of drawing everything, you must make these yoursef too. I expect you to spend around 15-20 hours on this assignment.

Marking scheme:

| Complexity | Code | Visuals | Jazz |
|------------|----|---------|------|
|30%         |20% |20%      |30%   |

| Grade | Description |
| ------|-------------|
| First | Multiple levels and powerups. Splash and game over screens. Progression and depth to the gameplay. Use of loops, arrays and methods extensively and correctly. Everything parameterised. Use of audio and fonts. Use of lots of advanced features of Processing we havent covered in class such as files, classes and libraries. 200+ lines of code |
| 2.1 | A single level, with bricks, a bat, a ball, scoring and collisions. Everything works. Between 100 and 200 lines of code. Correct use of methods, parameters, loops and arrays |
| 2.2 | A single level, with bricks, a bat, a ball, scoring but no collisions or some other significant bugs. Some duplicated code that could be replaced by an array or a loop. Some methods, but no parameters instead using global variables (or no methods). Around 100 lines of code |
| Pass | No loops or arrays, just some simple drawing in the draw method, or some attempt at loops that doesnt work. < 100 lines of code |
| Fail | Project won't compile or major issues. |

Rules!

- As much as possible this project should be 100% your own code. You will not get any marks for any code that include that you get from books or from the internet. This assignment is about testing what *you* have learned and what *you* can do.
- Any suspected plagorism will be dealt with according to DIT General Assessment Regulations. This could mean expulsion from DIT. I will personally grade all assignments.
- There will be a feedback session after the assignment where you will have the opportunity to get individual feedback on your submissiona and have your mark explained to you.
- The date for submission is before the lab, the week of 1 Feb 2016. 
- All assignment submissions must be demoed in the lab that week.
- If you need to submit an assignment late, you must submit a PC/1 form to the exams office.
